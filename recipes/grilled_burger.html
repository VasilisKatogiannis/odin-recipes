            <li>Put 1/3 of the bread, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, the onion and garlic, mint, parsley, oregano, and chicken bouillon cube into a chopper blender, and beat them until the cube is completely crushed.</li>
            <li>Put the remaining bread into a bowl and add water to soak it.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the bread well with your hands to remove all the moisture, and transfer it to a big bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the mixture from the blender, ground pork, ground beef, kefalotyri cheese, egg, salt, and pepper, and knead them well with your hands until completely combined.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove the ground meat from the refrigerator, shape 8 burger patties, 180 g each, and add the rest of the olive oil on top.</li>
            <li>Place a grill pan over medium heat and let it heat up well.</li>
            <li>Transfer the patties to the pan in 2 batches, and grill them for 3-4 minutes on each side until they are cooked through and nicely browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the grill pan from the heat and transfer the burger patties to a serving platter.</li>
